# HyperLogLog (HLL) - Core Module Documentation

This module implements the **HyperLogLog (HLL)** algorithm in Python, which is used for **cardinality estimation** (i.e., estimating the number of distinct elements in a dataset) with **low memory usage**.

## üîß Files Overview

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `core.py` | High-level API for creating, updating, and estimating cardinality using HLL. |
| `dense.py` | Handles dense register representation (used at higher cardinalities). |
| `sparse.py` | Handles sparse encoding (used at lower cardinalities). |
| `bias_correction.py` | Applies empirical bias correction to improve HLL accuracy. |
| `compression.py` | Converts between sparse and dense formats efficiently. |
| `serialization.py` | Provides serialization/deserialization support for HLL objects. |
| `hash_utils.py` | Utility functions for hashing, bit manipulations, and index extraction. |
| `constants.py` | Contains constants like thresholds, alpha values, and bias tables. |
| `__init__.py` | Makes this a Python package. |

## üìò core.py - Detailed Documentation

### üîπ Overview
This module defines the HyperLogLog class, the primary interface for approximate cardinality estimation in this implementation. It wraps around two internal implementations:

DenseHyperLogLog (from dense.py)

SparseHyperLogLog (from sparse.py)

The class automatically handles switching between sparse and dense representations based on the number of inserted elements, optimizing for both accuracy and memory efficiency.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Initialization
hll = HyperLogLog(b=14, mode='sparse', register=0)

b: Precision parameter. m = 2^b defines the number of registers (default is 14, i.e., 16,384 registers).

mode: Either 'sparse' or 'dense'.

register: Initial register state (default is 0).
